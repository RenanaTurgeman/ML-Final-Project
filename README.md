## üéì Project Overview
This project focuses on building an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
We experimented with various model architectures, including CNNs, and applied techniques like grayscale conversion and data augmentation to improve accuracy. 
Our final model achieved an accuracy of 85%, reflecting the effectiveness of these enhancements.
